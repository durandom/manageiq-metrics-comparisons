# Hawkular metrics as a data store

* posting to the same [metric / timestamp] combination with different tags overwrites datapoint
* not possible to clear metrics
* graphing options are rudimentary
  * [ HawkFX ]( https://github.com/pilhuhn/hawkfx ) is a native UI
  * [ Grafana Plugin ](https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-grafana-datasource) with limitations
    * [no aggregations](https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-grafana-datasource/issues/79)

## Running specs

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will give you hawkular metrics and grafana. Then execute the specs as this:

```
‚ùØ be rspec --format d spec.rb
"Tenant: miq-30833"
"name:cpu/resource_type:Vm/resource_id:01/host:01/ems:01"
"name:power/resource_type:Vm/resource_id:01/host:01/ems:01"
"name:cpu/resource_type:Vm/resource_id:02/host:01/ems:01"
"name:power/resource_type:Vm/resource_id:02/host:01/ems:01"

MetricStore
  aggregate vm data to a host
  downsample 15 minute granularity data to 1 hour buckets
  graph the number of vms running on a host (PENDING: FAILS: There is currently no API for fetching bucket data points across multiple availability metrics.)
  upsample 15 minute granularity data to 5 minute buckets with interpolated data (PENDING: FAILS: returns empty buckets and buckets with 1 sample)
  graph the max of cpu usage of all vms
